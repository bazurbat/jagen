### Working with source packages

```
Usage: jagen src <command> [PACKAGES...]

  Manage SCM package sources.

SYNOPSIS

  The optional PACKAGES argument should be the list of SCM packages defined in
  the current environment. If none are specified, all are assumed.

COMMANDS

  dirty   Check if packages source directories have any changes
  status  Show packages location, head commit and dirty status
  clean   Clean up packages source directories
  update  Update the sources to the latest upstream version
  clone   Clone the specified packages
  delete  Delete packages source directories

  The 'dirty' command exits with 0 (true) status if any of the specified
  packages source directories have changes. It exits with 1 (false) status if
  all sources are clean. Intended for usage by shell scripts.

  The 'status' command prints SCM packages status in human readable form.

  The 'clean' command resets modifications to the HEAD state and deletes
  all extra files in packages source directories.

  The 'update' command fetches the latest sources from upstream and tries to
  merge them. It does nothing if there are modifications in the working
  directory (dirty returns true); commit, stash or clean changes before issuing
  the 'update' command in this case.

  The 'clone' command clones the specified packages.

  The 'delete' command deletes packages source directories.
