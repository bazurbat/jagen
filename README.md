# Jagen

Jagen is a tool which eases development of multiple interdependent software
packages. It abstracts peculiarities of individual packages build systems and
provides means to manage them as a whole.

### Requirements

POSIX compatible shell, Lua 5.1 or 5.2 (or JuaJIT 2.0), [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).

## Getting Started

To start using Jagen execute the following commands:

```
cd ~/src                                          # 1
git clone https://github.com/bazurbat/jagen.git   # 2
mkdir root-genivi                                 # 3
cd root-genivi                                    # 4
../jagen/init-project genivi -a ccache            # 5
. ./env.sh                                        # 6
jagen build                                       # 7
```

1. Go to the work directory. Can be anything but we assume `~/src`.
2. Clone the Jagen itself into the `~/src/jagen` directory.
3. Create the `root-genivi` (`~/src/root-genivi`) directory alongside the Jagen
   clone which will become the root of the project.
4. Go to the just created directory.
5. Initialize the this directory as a project. The name "genivi" is one of the
   project templates distributed with Jagen. The "-a" option enables the
   "ccache" for the project.
6. Source the generated `env.sh` file to initialize the project environment.
   Repeat starting from this step each time you want to resume working with
   this project (i.e. to be able to run `jagen` command).
7. Build the project. The `build` command runs to completion, i.e. it ensures
   that all default targets are built, if it already the case â€” it does nothing
   (just as "make" for example).

See [Initializing](doc/Initializing.md) section in the manual for more details.

During the build the source repositories will be cloned to the `src` directory,
the distribution archives will be downloaded to the `dist` directory. Inspect
what is currently checked out with the `jagen src status` command.

You can find working directories along with build output files for each package
and stage in the `build` directory.

The results are installed to the `host` directory.

Use the `jagen list packages` command to see which packages compose the current
project and where to find their definitions. Inspect the referred files for
examples on how to write custom rules.

### Custom rules

Add project-specific rules to the `lib/rules.lua` file inside the project
directory. For example, write the following:

```lua
package { 'nanomsg', 'host',
    source = {
        type = 'git',
        location = 'https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg.git',
        branch = '1.1.2'
    },
    build = {
        type = 'CMake'
    }
}
```

And run the build again: `jagen build`.

You will see the `nanomsg` downloaded to the `src/nanomsg`, built in the
`build/nanomsg/host` and installed to the `host` subdirectory of the project.

### External project

If you want to use Jagen to manage an existing project add the following to the
`lib/rules.lua`:

```lua
package { 'myproject', 'host',
    source = {
        dir = '$HOME/src/myproject'
    },
    build = {
        type = 'CMake'
    },
    install = {
        type = 'none'
    }
}
```

Assuming it uses `CMake` as the build system. Note that you can use shell
variables in the values. Paths with spaces are also OK. Install 'none' means do
not install it to the `host` directory.

Run `jagen build` again to build the just added package. If some stage failed,
note the message similar to:
```
FAILED: jagen-pkg myproject compile host
```
and look to the `build/myproject__compile__host.log` for the build output of
this stage.

Once everything is built you can rebuild a single stage using the command:
`jagen build -fp myproject:compile:host`. Use the `-p` option to watch the
build output. See [Building](doc/Building.md) for more details.

Use the `jagen help` command or `--help` argument to the mentioned commands to
get more information about their possible options.

Do not forget to add `jagen/misc/bash_completion` to your Bash completion
configuration to make overall experience much more pleasant.

See [Manual](doc/Manual.md) for reference.
